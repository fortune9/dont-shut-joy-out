I used to dream about death.

Not in the way people fear it — not as a monster or a final curtain — but as a quiet, heartbreaking departure. In my dreams, my grandparents would leave me. Not because they didn’t love me — oh, no. It was the opposite. I loved them so fiercely, so completely, that the thought of them gone felt like losing the sky. I’d wake up trembling, clutching the sheets, heart pounding — not from fear of death itself, but from the terror of being left behind.

I didn’t understand death then. I only understood love — and how love could be so fragile, so easily taken away.

As I grew older, the dreams faded — but the reality didn’t. I watched people leave. Not in dreams. In real life. My grandparents — one after another — slipped away, like sand through my fingers. I held their hands, listened to their stories, laughed at their jokes — and then, one day, they were gone. And I was left with the echo of their voices and the silence where they used to be.

And then — just today — I saw death again.

Not in a dream. Not in a memory. In the flesh.

A young brother from our church — so full of life, so full of laughter, so full of potential — gone in an instant. An accident. A blink. A breath that never came back.

I stood there, stunned. Not just sad — shocked. Because when someone young dies, it doesn’t just hurt — it shatters your sense of time. You think, “This shouldn’t happen. Not now. Not to him. Not to anyone so young.” It’s not just grief — it’s a kind of disbelief. A question hanging in the air: Why?

And I don’t have an answer.

But I do have this: I’m still here. I’m still breathing. I’m still loving. I’m still remembering.

Death doesn’t erase life — it frames it. It reminds us how precious it is. How fragile. How fleeting. And how deeply we must love — not just when it’s easy, but when it’s hard. Not just when it’s safe, but when it’s terrifying.

I used to fear death because I loved too much. Now I understand — I still love too much. And that’s not a flaw. It’s a gift. It’s the reason I cry when I hear a song they used to sing. It’s the reason I pause when I see a certain tree — because Grandma used to sit under it. It’s the reason I still whisper, “I miss you,” even though you’re not here to hear it.

Death doesn’t win.

It doesn’t take the love. It doesn’t steal the memories. It doesn’t erase the laughter.

It only changes the shape of the story.

And the story — the one we’re still writing — is still full of love. Still full of light. Still full of people who matter.

So I’ll keep remembering. I’ll keep loving. I’ll keep showing up — even when it hurts. Even when it’s hard. Even when I’m not sure how to carry it.

Because death doesn’t end life.

It just changes the way we live it.

And I’m still here — still learning, still grieving, still loving — with all my heart.
